A work-in-progress project attempting to interpolate and understand the circle of fifths and their relation to Hindustani classical music thaats. 

Download this package, cd into the folder, and run 
``` python -m http.server 2021 ```
or ``` python3 -m http.server 2021 ``` if the above does not work. 

Then in a browser go to ```localhost:2021``` and you should see the code working.
